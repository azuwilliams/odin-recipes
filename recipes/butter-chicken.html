   <h2>Description:</h2>
   <h3>Serves 4 - 6</h3>
   <h3>Time to Table: ~ 30 mins</h3>
        <p>BUTTER! BUTTER! <em>BUTTER!</em></p>
        <p><strong>DAIRY ALLERGIES BEWARE</strong></p>
        <p>This classic North Indian dish is coming at ya with the power of delicious fatty b-u-t-t-e-r.</p>
        <p>This recipe is keto-friendly but unfortunately for any strict herbivores it is vegan-<em>unfriendly</em>.</p>
        <p><em>(You are welcome to make a vegan version of this dish, but I cannot guarantee the quality of the end product will be desirable. A vegetarian version of this dish will pair best with paneer as the chicken replacement.)</em></p>
        <p>This dish features marinated chicken added to a tomato and dairy heavy sauce, enriched by delicious and aromatic spices. The recipe on this page assumes the chicken has already been cooked, so find my recommended method of cooking <a href="../recipes/marinated-chicken.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
        <p>Traditonally this dish is served alongside long grain rice and naan, but eat it how you like. I won't judge if you eat it straight out of the pot. It tastes better over time but please enjoy or freeze within 5 days for safest results.</p>

            <li>16 oz can of tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp garam masala (recipe to make your own <a href="../recipes/garam-masala.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>)</li>
            <li>1 tbs cumin</li>

            <li>1 tsp cayanne pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice your onions and garlic. If using fresh garlic, dice at this time. Set to the side.</li>
            <li>Cut butter into pats.</li>
            <li>Heat an extra large skillet (or pot) to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add <strong>1 stick</strong> of butter and melt.</li>
            <li>Toss in onions and increase heat to medium-high until onions begin to brown <em>(for a more complex flavor, keep heat on medium and allow onions to caramelize, this will increase the recipe time by at least double).</em></li>
            <li>Add garlic, stir continuously for about one minute, or until fragrant. Be careful not to burn garlic.</li>
            <li>Add all seasonings (garam masala, cumin, tumeric, ginger, ground pepper, cayanne pepper, and salt). Stir until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Add remaining <strong>2 sticks</strong> of butter and heat until melted. Stir frequently to encourage melting.</li>
            <li>Add heavy cream & tomato sauce. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Your sauce should thicken.</li>
            <li>Taste sauce, add any additional ingredients at this time if desired.</li>
            <li>Add <a href="../recipes/marinated-chicken.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-cooked chicken.</a> Heat for an additional 10 minutes, or until internal temperature of chicken reaches at least 165Â°.</li>
            <li>Recommended to serve with rice and/or na'an. Will keep in fridge up to 5 days, but is best served warm. The sauce will thicken after it is cooled, and taste will get better the following day.</li>
        </ol>
